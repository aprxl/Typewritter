//! Timers that produce a 0..1 weight over wall-clock time.
//!
//! [`Animation`] is the whole primitive: a duration, an easing curve, and a
//! repeat mode. Everything an editor animates — cursor blink, smooth scroll,
//! a popup fading in, a diagnostic pulsing — is some value interpolated by a
//! weight this produces. Keyframes, springs, and sequences are all things
//! built *on* this later; none of them need to exist for it to be useful.
//!
//! Two ways to own one, for two different situations:
//!
//! 1. **Caller-owned** (the default). Store an [`Animation`] in whatever
//!    struct the animated thing lives in. This is right for almost
//!    everything — a cursor's blink belongs to the cursor.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    let mut blink = Animation::new(Duration::from_millis(500), Easing::Linear).ping_pong();
//!    let still_running = blink.advance(dt);   // once per frame
//!    let alpha = blink.weight();              // 0..1
//!    ```
//!
//! 2. **Keyed registry** ([`Animations`], opt-in). For animations that need
//!    to be addressable from somewhere that doesn't own them — a Lua plugin
//!    fading a panel it didn't create, say. One `advance` drives them all.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    animations.play("panel.fade", Animation::new(Duration::from_millis(120), Easing::EaseOut));
//!    let any_running = animations.advance(dt);
//!    let alpha = animations.weight("panel.fade");
//!    ```
//!
//! **`advance` returns whether the animation is still running**, which is the
//! signal the frame scheduler needs — see `frame::FrameScheduler`. An
//! animation that returns `false` has reached its final value, and that
//! final value is still what `weight()` reports, so the last frame drawn is
//! the finished state rather than a snap back to zero.
//!
//! **Feed `advance` a clamped delta.** Under a `ControlFlow::Wait` scheduler
//! the first frame after an idle gap has a multi-second frame time; passing
//! that through would teleport every animation to its end. `frame.rs` owns
//! that clamp.

// A foundation module: the entry points exist before the first caller does,
// and deleting the knobs would just mean adding them back for the first real
// animation. Same treatment as `input`'s query surface.
