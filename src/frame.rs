//! When to draw the next frame.
//!
//! The naive winit loop — `ControlFlow::Poll` plus an unconditional
//! `request_redraw()` — renders forever at display refresh rate, whether or
//! not anything changed. With vsync that isn't a runaway spin, but it is a
//! full CPU frame and GPU composite every vblank for a window showing a
//! static buffer. An editor is idle almost all the time; that is the wrong
//! default.
//!
//! [`FrameScheduler`] inverts it: **draw nothing until something asks.**
//! Input that changed state asks. A running animation asks, every frame, for
//! as long as it runs. Everything else costs zero frames.
//!
//! "Dirty" and "animating" are the same concept here — animating is just
//! asking again every frame. The only difference is pacing, which is why
//! this owns a target-FPS knob rather than a separate animation clock.
//!
//! Wiring, in an `ApplicationHandler`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn about_to_wait(&mut self, event_loop: &ActiveEventLoop) {
//!     // `should_draw_now`, not `wants_redraw` — see its doc. Requesting
//!     // early makes any FPS target silently do nothing.
//!     if self.scheduler.should_draw_now() {
//!         self.window.request_redraw();
//!     }
//!     event_loop.set_control_flow(self.scheduler.control_flow());
//! }
//!
//! // in WindowEvent::RedrawRequested, *before* per-frame logic:
//! self.scheduler.begin_frame();
//! let dt = FrameScheduler::animation_delta(renderer.get_frametime());
//! if animations.advance(dt) {
//!     self.scheduler.request_redraw();   // still animating -> one more frame
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `begin_frame` clears the pending request at the *top* of the frame, so
//! anything the frame itself requests survives to the next `about_to_wait`.
//! Clearing at the end would swallow it and the animation would stall after
//! one frame.
