//! Renderer — GPU layer abstraction.
//!
//! The renderer's public surface is [`Renderer`] (owns the wgpu device,
//! surface, and the shared GPU resources every [`Layer`] draws through) and
//! [`Layer`] itself (a retained, independently-cached drawing surface with
//! `draw_*` methods — see `layer.rs`'s module doc for the full design).
//! `Layer` handles are ordinary values: create one with
//! [`Renderer::new_layer_top`]/[`Renderer::new_layer_bottom`] and call its
//! `draw_*` methods from anywhere that holds the handle — a `Layer` needs
//! no reference back to the `Renderer` to be drawn into.
//!
//! All wgpu types are kept private to this module (and its submodules) so
//! the rest of the codebase only sees [`Renderer`], [`Layer`], and the
//! plain-data vocabulary types (`Color`, `Rounding`, `Alignment`, `Font`,
//! `FontParameters`, `Pixels`) each `draw_*` method takes.
