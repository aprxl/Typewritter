//! Frame-based input state, fed from winit events.
//!
//! winit delivers input as a stream of one-shot events; almost every caller
//! actually wants to ask *state* questions ("is Ctrl held right now?",
//! "where is the mouse?") at an arbitrary point in a frame. [`Input`] sits
//! between the two: [`Input::handle_event`] absorbs the event stream,
//! everything else is a cheap state query callable from anywhere.
//!
//! The frame contract is the one thing a caller has to get right:
//!
//! 1. forward every `WindowEvent` to [`Input::handle_event`] (and every
//!    `DeviceEvent` to [`Input::handle_device_event`], if raw motion is
//!    wanted),
//! 2. read whatever state the frame needs,
//! 3. call [`Input::end_frame`] exactly once at the end of the frame.
//!
//! `end_frame` is what makes the edge-triggered queries (`is_key_pressed`,
//! `is_key_released`, `mouse_delta`, `scroll_delta`, `text`) mean "since the
//! last frame" rather than "since the program started". Skipping it leaves
//! every edge query permanently true.
//!
//! Composed text — dead keys, system input methods (macOS's dead-key
//! sequences, CJK IMEs, the hold-key accent popover) — arrives as
//! `WindowEvent::Ime` and is folded into the same per-frame `text()` buffer
//! as ordinary typing. winit only delivers those events when IME is allowed,
//! which `Window::set_ime_allowed(true)` (set in `main.rs`) turns on.
//!
//! **Stuck-key safety.** Losing focus mid-chord (alt-tab while holding
//! Ctrl) is the classic way input state desyncs: the OS delivers the press
//! but the release goes to whoever has focus now. [`WindowEvent::Focused`]`(false)`
//! therefore force-releases every held key, button, and modifier — see
//! [`Input::release_all`]. Positions are kept (the cursor didn't move), only
//! held-ness is dropped.
